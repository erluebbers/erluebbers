Hi, I'm Erik Luebbers

I'm a software engineer daily working to grow a stronger foundation in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and React.

For my current learning, I'm interested in so many things and I'm currently learning more about the conceptually challenging parts of JavScript to help build a stronger foundation as I work on tackling more challenging projects. 

I'm very interested in collaborating on projects for civic good, bringing technology to bear on issues such as LGBTQ advocacy, healthcare, housing, and mutual aid.
